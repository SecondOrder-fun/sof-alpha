/**
 * @title DeployInfoFiSepolia
 * @notice Deployment script for InfoFi system on Base Sepolia testnet
 * @dev This script assumes the core raffle system (SOF, Raffle, SeasonFactory, BondingCurve, etc.)
 *      has already been deployed by 00_DeployToSepolia.s.sol and that the following env vars are set:
 *
 *      - RAFFLE_ADDRESS_TESTNET
 *      - SOF_ADDRESS_TESTNET
 *      - INFOFI_ORACLE_ADDRESS_TESTNET
 *      - RAFFLE_ORACLE_ADAPTER_ADDRESS_TESTNET
 *
 *      For testnet we use the deployer as both admin and treasury. For mainnet production we
 *      recommend a dedicated Liquidity Provider / treasury wallet instead of the deployer.
