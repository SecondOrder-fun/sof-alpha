# SecondOrder.fun Project Tasks

## Project Overview

SecondOrder.fun is a full-stack Web3 platform that transforms cryptocurrency speculation into structured, fair finite games through applied game theory enhanced with InfoFi (Information Finance) integration. The platform combines transparent raffle mechanics with sophisticated prediction markets to create a multi-layer system enabling cross-layer strategies, real-time arbitrage opportunities, and information-based value creation.
