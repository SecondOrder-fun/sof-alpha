# SecondOrder.fun Project Tasks

## Project Overview

SecondOrder.fun is a full-stack Web3 platform that transforms cryptocurrency speculation into structured, fair finite games through applied game theory enhanced with InfoFi (Information Finance) integration. The platform combines transparent raffle mechanics with sophisticated prediction markets to create a multi-layer system enabling cross-layer strategies, real-time arbitrage opportunities, and information-based value creation.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)

- Complete project structure initialization
- Set up development environments
- Implement basic frontend layout
- Create initial smart contract framework

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Week 3-4)

- Implement raffle mechanics
- Develop InfoFi market contracts
- Build frontend components for raffle display
- Create backend services for data management

### Phase 3: Integration (Week 5-6)

- Connect frontend to backend services
- Integrate Web3 functionality
- Implement real-time SSE updates
- Develop cross-layer strategy components

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement (Week 7-8)

- Comprehensive testing of all components
- Security audits of smart contracts
- Performance optimization
- User experience refinement

## Discovered During Work

- [x] Fix all backend Fastify route lint errors (unused vars, undefined identifiers, unreachable code)
- [x] Fix all backend/config lint errors (process, require, __dirname, unused vars)
- [x] Fix all frontend unused variable/import warnings
- [x] Design and document InfoFi market API endpoints
- [x] Implement mock implementations for placeholder backend endpoints:
  - [x] Raffle endpoints (`/api/raffles`)
  - [x] User profile endpoints (`/api/users`)
  - [x] SSE pricing stream endpoint (`/api/pricing/markets/:id/pricing-stream`)
<!-- New tasks discovered during development will be added here -->
