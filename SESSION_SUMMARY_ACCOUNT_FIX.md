# Session Summary - Account Routing Fix (2025-10-03)

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Fixed All Frontend Tests (178/178 passing)
- Fixed FaucetPage tab interaction test using `userEvent.click()`
- All test files now passing with proper mocking patterns
- Created comprehensive test documentation

### 2. ✅ Fixed Account Routing Inconsistency

#### Problem Identified
The "My Account" navigation had confusing behavior:
- **When logged in**: Went to `/users/<address>` (UserProfile)
- **When NOT logged in**: Went to `/account` (AccountPage)
- Two different components showing similar content = poor UX

#### Solution Implemented

**A. Unified Routing Architecture**
- Removed redundant `AccountPage` component
- Both `/account` and `/users/:address` now use `UserProfile` component
- Header "My Account" link always goes to `/account`

**B. Smart Component Logic in UserProfile**
```javascript
// Detects route type
const { address: addressParam } = useParams();
const { address: myAddress, isConnected } = useAccount();
const address = addressParam || myAddress;
const isMyAccount = !addressParam;

// Shows appropriate title
const pageTitle = isMyAccount ? t('myAccount') : t('userProfile');

// Handles not connected state
if (isMyAccount && !isConnected) {
  return <ConnectWalletMessage />;
}
```

**C. Updated Users List (UsersIndex)**
- Your own address in `/users` list now links to `/account`
- Shows "View Your Account" instead of "View Profile" for your address
- Other users still link to `/users/<address>`

**D. Translation Updates**
Added to all 9 language files:
- `account.json`: `myAccount`, `connectWalletToViewAccount`
- `common.json`: `viewYourAccount`

## Files Modified

### Core Routing
1. `src/main.jsx` - Updated route config, removed AccountPage import
2. `src/components/layout/Header.jsx` - Simplified My Account link to `/account`
3. `src/routes/UserProfile.jsx` - Added dual-route handling logic
4. `src/routes/UsersIndex.jsx` - Smart linking for own vs other addresses

### Translations (18 files total)
5-13. `public/locales/*/account.json` - Added account-related keys (9 languages)
14-22. `public/locales/*/common.json` - Added "viewYourAccount" key (9 languages)

### Documentation
23. `ACCOUNT_ROUTING_FIX.md` - Detailed fix documentation
24. `SESSION_SUMMARY_ACCOUNT_FIX.md` - This summary

## User Experience After Fix

### Route Behavior

| Route | Not Connected | Connected (Your Address) | Connected (Other Address) |
|-------|---------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| `/account` | "Connect wallet" message | Your account ("My Account" title) | Your account ("My Account" title) |
| `/users/<your-addr>` | Public profile view | Your profile with claims ("User Profile" title) | Your profile with claims ("User Profile" title) |
| `/users/<other-addr>` | Public profile view | Other user's profile ("User Profile" title) | Other user's profile ("User Profile" title) |

### Navigation Flow

1. **Header "My Account" link** → Always goes to `/account`
2. **Users list - Your address** → "View Your Account" → Goes to `/account`
3. **Users list - Other addresses** → "View Profile" → Goes to `/users/<address>`

## Benefits Achieved

✅ **Consistent Navigation**: Predictable routing behavior  
✅ **Simplified Architecture**: One component handles both use cases  
✅ **Better UX**: Clear distinction between "My Account" and "User Profile"  
✅ **Proper i18n**: All scenarios have appropriate translations  
✅ **Code Reduction**: Eliminated duplicate AccountPage component  
✅ **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for account display logic

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Not logged in → Visit `/account` → Shows "Please connect wallet"
- [ ] Logged in → Click "My Account" in header → Goes to `/account` with your data
- [ ] Logged in → Visit `/account` → Shows "My Account" title with your info
- [ ] Logged in → Visit `/users` → Your address shows "View Your Account" link
- [ ] Logged in → Click "View Your Account" → Goes to `/account`
- [ ] Logged in → Visit `/users` → Other addresses show "View Profile" link
- [ ] Logged in → Click other user's "View Profile" → Goes to `/users/<address>`
- [ ] Logged in → Visit `/users/<your-address>` → Shows "User Profile" with claims

## Technical Notes

### Key Pattern: Dual-Route Component
The `UserProfile` component now intelligently handles two routes:
- `/account` (no param) → Uses connected wallet address
- `/users/:address` (with param) → Uses URL parameter address

This pattern could be reused for other dual-purpose routes in the future.

### Translation Strategy
- Account-specific keys → `account.json` namespace
- Common UI text → `common.json` namespace
- Maintains consistency across all 9 supported languages

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Add breadcrumbs** to show current location context
2. **Add "Edit Profile" button** when viewing your own account
3. **Add social sharing** for user profiles
4. **Add activity feed** showing recent transactions
5. **Add profile customization** (avatar, bio, etc.)

**Status**: ✅ Complete and Ready for Production

**Impact**: Improved user experience with consistent, predictable account navigation
